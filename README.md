## ðŸ¤– Getting started

You can find any ADR inside the `records` folder, grouped based on their context. Every file is a **markdown** file, versioned adequately so that you could understand the discussions and rationale of every decision.

We're organizing our records with a prefix of three numbers to understand the sequencing between those decisions clearly. 

For example, if you want to learn more about our **stack decision**, you should look at the following file: `records/patterns/011-stack.md`.

## ðŸ’» Contributing

Contributions are what make our company such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. You can learn how to contribute to this project on the [`CONTRIBUTING`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
