## ðŸ¤– Getting started

To understand our architecture decision logs repository you must first understand two separate concepts:

1. `Architecture Decision Record`: The record of an architecture decision. To understand what is an ADR, check our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file;
2. `Architecture Decision Group`: A group of architecture decision records. Those are arbitrary, ad-hoc groups (like folders) of more than one ADR. Inside each ADG you will only find symbolic links to any ADR related to it. Some example of ADGs are:
- Accepted
- Rejected
- Deprecated
- Domain-related

So, if you want to check **all our architecture decisions**, you could check the `adr` folder. If you wish to navigate in how we're organizing our ADRs you can go to the `adg` folder of this repository. While in the `adg` folder, keep in mind that it only contains symbolic links, so the folder structure might change anytime.
